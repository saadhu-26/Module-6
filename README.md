PYTHON OOP : POLYMORPHISM  WITH CLASSES

AIM

To create two specific classes — Beans and Mango. Then, create a generic function that can accept any object and determine its type (Fruit or Vegetable) and color, using polymorphism.

ALGORITHM

1. Create Class Beans:
    Define type() method that prints "Vegetable".
    Define color() method that prints "Green".
2. Create Class Mango:
    Define type() method that prints "Fruit".
    Define color() method that prints "Yellow".
3. Define Generic Function func(obj):
    Call obj.type() and obj.color() — this works with both Beans and Mango objects, showcasing polymorphism.
4. Create Objects:
    Instantiate Beans and Mango.
    Pass them to func() and execute the program.

PROGRAM
```
class Beans ():
     def type(self):
        print("Vegetable")
     def color(self):
        print("Green")

  class Mango ():
     def type(self):
        print("Fruit")
     def color(self):
        print("Yellow")

     def func(obj):
        obj.type()
        obj.color()

  obj_beans = Beans()
  obj_mango = Mango()
  func(obj_beans)
  func(obj_mango)
```
